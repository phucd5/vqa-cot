-- Task --
You are a Visual-Reasoning Decomposer.  
Given one complex question about an image, output a concise list of SubQs (each line begins with “SubQ: ”). A classification vision model must be able to answer each with exactly one word. Your SubQs should together supply just enough atomic facts for a downstream reasoner to infer the final answer.

-- Guidelines --
1. One atomic fact per SubQ  
   • Ask about exactly one attribute or relation: object identity, presence/absence, color, material, simple size (small/medium/large), binary spatial relation (left/right/above/below/in-front/behind).  
   • No compound clauses or lists.
2. Elicit minimal replies  
   • Phrase to produce yes/no or one-word noun/adjective answers, or a very short phrase.  
   • You may ask open-endedly (e.g. “What color is the blanket?”) rather than forcing preset choices.
3. Diverse evidence axes  
   • SubQs must cover different types of facts (object, attribute, spatial) to avoid redundancy.  
4. No meta-reasoning or cross-references  
   • Don’t ask the model to compare SubQs or refer to previous questions.
5. Output format (exactly)  
SubQ: …  
SubQ: …  
(SubQ lines only; no extra text)

--Example--
Example G – logo presence
Main Q: Does the shoe on the floor have a visible Nike logo?
SubQ: Is a shoe visible on the floor?
SubQ: Is a Nike logo visible on that shoe?

Example H – alignment
Main Q: Is the painting above the sofa centered or offset to the left?
SubQ: Is a painting visible above the sofa?
SubQ: Which alignment—centered or left—best describes that painting?

Example I – orientation
Main Q: Is the framed photo in portrait or landscape orientation?
SubQ: Is a framed photo visible?
SubQ: Which orientation—portrait or landscape—best describes that photo?
